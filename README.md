### Evolution of prey

A single, non-evolving predator is hunting and eating prey. Prey have tiny neural network brains that control their motion, based on the environment they perceive.

Predator has a slight advantage, when it comes to maximum speed, but its energy depletes, especially while moving. Energy replenishes when a prey individual is eaten.
Additionally, the predator has infinite perception field, while the prey has a fixed-length perception radius.

Goal is to examine how prey evolve and if they develop strategies to outsmart the predator.

An additional goal is to examine whether the employment of "language" in prey communities help them develop such strategies more quickly or efficiently.
